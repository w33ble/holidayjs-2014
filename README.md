# Prototool2

A redux on the original [prototool](https://github.com/colonyamerican/prototool), this is a tool for quickly prototyping and compiling frontend web applications.

It's powered by [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and a lot of the file structure is inspired by [gulp-starter](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter).
